## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/) - For rendering maps
- [Geo Ipify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - For finding location using IP address

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet API Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html) - The official documentation page of Leaflet API, which I used for maps. It is a great reference for those who have just started with maps in javascript.

## Acknowledgments

I am extremely impressed by the work that front-end mentor is doing. It helps us, new web-developers to put our skills to test by building websites. It helps us apply what we have learnt and eventually become better at what we do.
